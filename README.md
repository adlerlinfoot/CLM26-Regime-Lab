CLM26 Regime Lab



This repository contains an in-progress decision-support tool designed for the

WTI Crude Oil (CLM26) futures trading game in ARE 3225 (Spring 2026).



The goal is to identify \*\*current market regimes\*\* and estimate \*\*probable next

regimes\*\* under the game’s constraints:



\- Maximum 10 open contracts

\- Trades only on Mondays and Wednesdays

\- Execution at daily closing prices

\- Forced close on March 25, 2026



This project is intentionally incomplete and under active development.

The current version includes data loading, feature engineering, and a preliminary

regime classification engine.



\## Status



\*\*Experimental — testing in progress.\*\*  

Regime definitions and heuristics will evolve as more data is analyzed.



\## License



This project is for academic use only.
